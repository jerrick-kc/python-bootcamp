############### Our Blackjack House Rules #####################

## The deck is unlimited in size.
## There are no jokers.
## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
## The computer is the dealer.

##################### Hints #####################

#Hint 1: Go to this website and try out the Blackjack game:
#   https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/
#Then try out the completed Blackjack project here:
#   http://blackjack-final.appbrewery.repl.run

#Hint 2: Read this breakdown of program requirements:
#   http://listmoz.com/view/6h34DJpvJBFVRlZfJvxF
#Then try to create your own flowchart for the program.

#Hint 3: Download and read this flow chart I've created:
#   https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rDkiHCrhaf9eX7u7yjM1qwSuyEk-rPnt

#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
import random


def deal_card():
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    return random.choice(cards)

#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input
#and returns the score.
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
def calculate_score(cards_list):
    total_sum = sum(cards_list)
    # Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
    if total_sum == 21 and len(cards_list) == 2:
        return 0
    # Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
    elif total_sum > 21 and 11 in cards_list:
        cards_list.remove(11)
        cards_list.append(1)
        total_sum = sum(cards_list)
        return total_sum
    else:
        return total_sum


#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score.
# If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw.
# If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses.
# If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins.
# If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses.
# If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses.
# If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.
def compare(user_score, computer_score):
    if user_score == computer_score:
        print("Its a draw!")
    elif computer_score == 0:
        print("Computer wins")
    elif user_score == 0:
        print("You win")
    elif user_score > 21:
        print("Computer wins")
    elif computer_score > 21:
        print("You win")
    elif computer_score > user_score:
        print("Computer wins")
    else:
        print("You win")

    #Hint 12: Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.

    print(f"Computer's cards: {computer_cards}, Computer's total: {comp_total}")

    #Hint 14: Ask the user if they want to restart the game. If they answer yes, clear the console and start a new game of blackjack and show the logo from art.py.
